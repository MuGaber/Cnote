This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## cNote

A web-based note taking app

# Motivation

I like taking notes mostly about the new things i am learning, but most applications
out there in my opinion is not feature complete for my use cases, so i have searched
for a while and i have decided to build my own app.

this app is highly inspired by this awesome open-source project
[takenote](https://github.com/taniarascia/takenote)

# additions

add/sync notes to/from localStorage

even though we are going to make a seperate reducer for syncing
we are going to modify the noteReducer based on sync action
